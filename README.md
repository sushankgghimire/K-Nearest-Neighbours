#K-Nearest Neighbours

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers are widely recognized for their simplicity and effectiveness in various machine learning tasks, including classification and regression. Their intuitive nature
and ability to handle large datasets efficiently have made them popular in diverse domains. In this study, we explore the application of K-Nearest Neighbors in the context of predicting students’ dropout and academic success, using a dataset that comprises various attributes related to students’ demographics, past performance, and socio-economic factors. The goal is to investigate whether the provided attributes can reliably predict whether a student is likely to drop out or achieve academic success. This research seeks to leverage the KNN algorithm’s ability to classify instances based on their proximity to existing data points. By measuring the distance between instances in the dataset and their k-nearest neighbors, we aim to develop a predictive model that effectively classifies students into categories of dropout or academic success.
